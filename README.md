# Vowel_Consonant_counter

A basic vowel and consonant counter in JavaScript can be made real-time by updating the count dynamically as the user types. This can be achieved using event listeners like input or keyup that trigger the counting function every time the user modifies the text in an input field. This way, the vowel and consonant count will be displayed and updated instantly without needing to refresh or submit the input.
